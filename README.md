## Contribution Rules
1. Please raise a PR before merging a new feature — it helps contributors track your progress.
2. PRs should be merged in the presence of at least 2 developers.
3. Provide a short and clear commit message that briefly overviews the changes made.
4. Every PR must be linked to an issue (create one if it doesn’t exist).
5. Avoid committing directly to the main branch — always use feature branches.
6. If you’re working on a large feature, please update progress in the project board channel regularly.
7. Keep sensitive information (API keys, tokens, credentials) out of commits — use .env files and .gitignore.
8. Before merging, run all tests and linters locally and ensure the build passes.

Respect inclusive communication and maintain a collaborative, open-source friendly environment.
